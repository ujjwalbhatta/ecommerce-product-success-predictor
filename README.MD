# Amazon Rating Prediction Project

Build a machine learning system that predicts product ratings to help product managers make stocking decisions.

**Example Use Case:**
- **Input:** price=$25, category="Electronics/Accessories", brand="GenericBrand", description="Durable silicone case with kickstand"
- **Output:** "‚ö†Ô∏è 2.8/5 star rating expected - HIGH RISK product"

## üìä Dataset
Using **Amazon Reviews 2023** dataset from McAuley Lab:
- **Source:** https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/
- **Category:** Electronics (43.9M reviews, 18.3M users, 1.6M items)
- **Sample Size:** 30,000 merged records for this project

## üìÅ Data Files Required
Download these files from the website:
1. `Electronics.jsonl` - Review data (ratings, text, user info)
2. `meta_Electronics.jsonl` - Product metadata (title, price, features, etc.)

Run file data_extraction.ipynb file to save the new data in csv format with everything you need.


## üìã Output Dataset Features

### From Product Metadata:
- `main_category` - Product category
- `product_title` - Product name
- `average_rating` - Overall product rating
- `rating_number` - Number of ratings
- `price` - Product price in USD
- `description` - Product description (list format)
- `parent_asin` - Unique product ID

üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline
1. data_cleaning.ipynb
Handle missing values and outliers (e.g., drop products with missing price, filter unrealistic values).
Normalize text fields (lowercasing, removing special characters, etc.).
Save cleaned and merged dataset into a CSV file for downstream use.
Output: [cleaned_data.csv](data/processed/amazon_electronics_clean.csv)

2. feature_engineering.ipynb
This notebook transforms the cleaned dataset into machine learning‚Äìready features.
